# HeteroDoc Editor

Here is HeteroDoc Editor's source code directory. 

It's not ready for publishing as a independent NPM package, but we can use it like this:

```ts
import { createEditor } from '~/editor'
```

Every method and API is documented by their types and comments. 
You can hover on the function name in VS Code to see the description.
